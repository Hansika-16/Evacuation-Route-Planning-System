# Evacuation Route Planning System

A command-line C application for managing a road network and finding shortest evacuation routes during emergency situations using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

## Overview

This project represents locations as nodes and roads as weighted edges. Users can add or remove roads, block unsafe routes, mark safe zones, and calculate shortest evacuation paths from a given source location.

## Features

- Add, remove, block, and unblock roads  
- Mark and display safe zones  
- Find shortest evacuation paths  
- Detect unreachable locations  
- Menu-driven terminal interface  

## Concepts Used

- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Arrays and Functions
- Menu-driven Programming in C

## Project Workflow

1. User enters the number of locations in the system  
2. The road network is initialized  
3. User interacts with a menu to:
   - Add or remove roads  
   - Block or unblock roads  
   - Mark safe zones  
4. User selects a source location for evacuation  
5. The system calculates shortest distances and evacuation paths  
6. Results are displayed on the terminal  
7. Program exits safely when selected
